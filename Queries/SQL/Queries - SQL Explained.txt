Queries - SQL Explained
Joins
- link tables with each other so that the datasheet and reports are generated correctly
- ensures data from both tables relate to the correct records

Order By
- sort first by the date from oldest to most recent (chronological order)
- records that share the same data are then sorted by the next field specified
- cannot only sort by IDs because the photos are not given their IDs by date; they are mixed up

User-Entered Parameters
- opens a dialog box and runs user's input
- when match is found in database, condition is run and creates a datasheet
- dialog box specifies what should be entered
- also contains clarification sometimes in brackets
- for Year and EventID, numerical value is needed
- for date, value in yyyy-mm-dd or yyy/mm/dd is needed
- otherwise shows error message
- in Event query, can choose by ID OR occasion or both - data entered into both dialog boxes is searched for


FieldName AS DisplayName
- More professional and intuitive names
- Named after contents
- Gives more professional appearance
- Easier to find where picture is
